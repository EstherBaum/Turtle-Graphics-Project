# Christmas Scene Final Project
For this project I created a simple Chrismtas scene in PyCharm which generate a 
Christmas tree, tree skirt, presents, and a star. 

## Running Code
To run this code open it up in an IDE, PyCharm for example.
Once inside PyCharm or your IDE of choice run the code. 
It will ask you to input the size of the tree, whether small, medium, 
or large. If you enter it incorrectly it will prompt you to enter it again. 
Next it will ask for the number of presents you would like under the tree. 
After you enter the number the program will begin drawing your selection.

### Program order
Once the input is entered it will generate the tree skirt, the presents
behind the tree, the tree, the star on top of the tree, and lastly
it generates the presents in the front of the tree.
